# Tensorflow-Problem-Sheet

### Tensorflow Problem Sheet - Emerging Technologies Module - 4th Year Software Development 

#### RÃ­ona Greally - G00325504

In this Problem Sheet we import the [IRIS.csv](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/iris.csv) dataset and create a model using [Keras](https://keras.io/). We then train and test this model and save it to a h5 file. The Solutions to this Problem sheet is done using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

#### Keras
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

* Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
* Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
* Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

#### Here is the Tensorflow Problem sheet:
## Problem set: Tensorflow

These problems relate to the Python package Tensorflow. We will again use the famous iris data set. Save your work as a single Jupyter notebook file in a GitHub repository. Include any required data files, a README, and a gitignore file in the repository.

### 1. Use Tensorflow to create model

Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flower's sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

### 2. Split the data into training and testing

Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.

### 3. Train the model

Use the testing set to train your model.

### 4. Test the model

Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.
